"""The signal side of the bound: what density contrast a TB finding actually presents.

The resolution floor in `floor.py` says what the photograph *can* carry. That is
only half a certificate. The other half is what the finding *is*: a lesion has a
characteristic optical-density contrast against the lung field around it and a
characteristic size, and the certificate is the comparison of the two.

Read this section before quoting a number
-----------------------------------------
The values below are **nominal defaults**, chosen to be physically sensible for
screen-film chest radiography and internally consistent with `D_LUNG_RANGE`. They
are *not* measured, and they are not taken from a specific published table. Every
entry carries `source="NOMINAL"` for exactly that reason.

They are structured so that replacing them is a one-line change, and any
publication using this code must replace them, by either:

* transcribing contrast and size ranges from a radiographic physics reference or
  a contrast-detail study, and recording the citation in `source`; or
* measuring them directly -- expose a contrast-detail phantom (a CDRAD-style plate
  or, more cheaply, a step wedge with drilled cavities) on the same film/processor
  combination the clinic uses, and read the densities off with a densitometer.

`load_findings` reads a YAML or CSV table so the swap needs no code change at all.

Until that happens, the certificate's *relative* statements -- this photo carries
less density resolution than that one, this glare hotspot costs you a factor of
three, the floor rose above the contrast when the veil passed 15% -- are sound,
because they depend only on the floor. The *absolute* verdicts (`DETECTABLE` vs
`INSUFFICIENT` for a named finding) inherit the uncertainty of these numbers, and
`FindingSpec.delta_d_sigma` is what carries it into the reported margin.

Sign convention: `delta_d` is a magnitude. A consolidation is more attenuating
than the lung it replaces, so it *lowers* density; a cavity's air-filled lumen
raises it. Detection depends on the magnitude of the step, so the table stores
magnitudes and `film.insert_lesion` owns the sign.
